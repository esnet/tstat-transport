# Tstat (TCP STatistic and Analysis Tool) Transport Tools

Client programs to read a tstat file hierarchy, parse the logs, convert them to JSON objects, and send them to a remote archive (like a RabbitMQ server). This tool was originally developed to support the [National Science Foundation NetSage Project](http://www.netsage.global/home).
